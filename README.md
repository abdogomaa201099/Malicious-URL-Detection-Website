# Malicious-URL-Detection-System

A friendly and sample user interface was designed and develop to facilitated the detection of the malicious URL. Random Forest as a Machine learning technique was used to achieve the system objectives. The model was trained based on the URL lexical features. The developed malicious URL detection system can be platform-independent and can be integrated with the existing anti-malware systems and existing web browsing tools. 

The website scans URLs using the pre-trained machine learning model and provide a report to show the scan the result along with providing pie chart to simplify the result. The system enables the registered users to review the previously generated reports. It also, provide real-time scanning by capturing the user's network traffic to get the packets that go out from the PC and filtering them to get the URLs to scan it using the ML model.
